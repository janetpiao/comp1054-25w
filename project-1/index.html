          Look at the stars<br />
          Look how they shine for you<br />
          And everything you do<br />
          Yeah, they were all yellow<br />
          I came along<br />
          I wrote a song for you<br />
          And all the things you do<br />
          And it was called "Yellow"<br />
          So then I took my turn<br />
          Oh, what a thing to have done<br />
          And it was all yellow<br />
          your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br />
          (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br />
          (Aah) and you know, you know I love you so<br />
          You know I love you so<br />
          I swam across<br />
          I jumped across for you<br />
          Oh, what a thing to do<br />
          'Cause you were all yellow<br />
          I drew a line<br />
          I drew a line for you<br />
          Oh, what a thing to do<br />
          And it was all yellow<br />

          "Yellow" is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. I have loved
          this song for a long time—it brings me bright energy and makes me feel
          positive and energetic.
